Here is a partial list of results based on running Mætning on a
selection of problems from the ILTP library.

The following problems are classified as "Open" in the ILTP (i.e. it
is presumably unknown whether they are intuitionistically true or
not). Barring any fatal bugs in Mætning, some of these have now been
resolved:

SYN036+2.p:
  ILTP status: OPEN
  Status: Still unknown.
