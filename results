Here is a partial list of results based on running Mætning on a
selection of problems from the ILTP library.

The following problems are classified as "Open" in the ILTP (i.e. it
is presumably unknown whether they are intuitionistically true or
not). Barring any fatal bugs in Mætning, some of these have now been
resolved.

Note in particular the problems marked as being theorems of classical
logic. For these problems, attempting to refute the problem using
classical means cannot succeed.
