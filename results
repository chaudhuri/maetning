Here is a partial list of results based on running Mætning on a
selection of problems from the ILTP library.

The following problems are classified as "Open" in the ILTP (i.e. it
is presumably unknown whether they are intuitionistically true or
not). Barring any fatal bugs in Mætning, some of these have now been
resolved:

SYN036+2.p:
  ILTP status: OPEN
  Status: Still unknown.  

SYN053+1.p:
  ILTP status: OPEN
  Status: REFUTED
  Time: ~33s

SYN417+1:
  ILTP status: OPEN
  Status: PROVED
  Time: ~3.7s
  Note: The time given is for proving only one direction of the
        bi-implication. Both directions take roughly 3.7 seconds to
        prove.

SYN726+1.p:
  ILTP status: OPEN
  Status: REFUTED
  Time: ~0.06s

SYN954+1.p:
  ILTP status: OPEN
  Status: REFUTED
  Time: ~0.05s
