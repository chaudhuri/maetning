Predicate "q" is now treated as: NEGATIVE.
[LABEL] Labeled formulas:
          right #1⁺ := ∃X. ∀Y. #3⁻(Y,X) ⊃ #2⁻(X) ⊃ q⁻(X)
          local #3⁻('12,?11) := p⁻('12) ⊃ q⁻(?11)
          local #2⁻(?11) := p⁻(?11)
        Goal is #1
[INDEX] [1] #2(?1) --> p(?1)
[INDEX] [2] #3('2,?1), #2('2) --> q(?1)
